<h2>History</h2>

    Inspired by TinyMUD and AberMUD Lars Pensjö started a new
    gamedriver called LPMud for which he invented a new programming
    language LPC, an object oriented language loosely based on C.
    The gamedriver implemented a virtual machine for the execution of LPC code.
    In the same year Genesis opened as the first public MUD using this game driver.
